ANSWER:

Primitive arguments, such as an int or a double, are passed into methods by value.
Reference data type parameters, such as objects, are also passed into methods by value. 
This means that when the method returns, the passed-in reference still references the same object as before.


Standard output:

1. Result: 0

3. Result: 0
4. Result: [2, 3]
