# QUESTION:

	I would like to know the detailed difference between ActionServlet and Action class?

ANSWER:
	ActionServlet acts as a front controller and delegates its responsibility 
	of controller to various action classes. 
	Action classes act as the controller in the MVC pattern. Action classes respond to a user action, 
	execute business logic (or call upon other classes to do that), and then return a result that 
	tells Struts what view to render. 

# QUESTION:

	What is the difference between Abstract class and Interface? 
	How do we choose which one to use?

ANSWER:
	The main difference are: 
	
	- you can implements many interfaces, but you can extends only one abstract class 
	- you can have some concrete method in an abstract class, but not in an interface 
	
	So if you need to build a skeleton with some functionality already ready you have to use an abstract class. 
	Instead if you need to inform a class to guarantee some operation is better an interface. 
	If you look at the java.util package you will see many examples of interfaces and abstract classes. 
	
	For example Collection and List are interfaces, but AbstractList is an abstract class used for both Vector and ArrayList.

	NOTE FROM ORACLE DOCS:

	Interface defines the contract between the client and functionality provider. 
	Meaning, we can define objects with different implementations and behaviors but which share the same meaning 
	
	Abstraction: Keeping things as generic as possible. 
	In Object Oriented world, specific objects will usually are extensions of Abstract classes, sharing the generic behaviour. 


# QUESTION:

	Do we need to implement cloneable interface for singleton class. It's right or wrong? please explain.

ANSWER:

	You don't need to implements Cloneable in the singleton pattern. 
	Singleton means that you need only one object for that class. So it is incorrect to 
	have a second instance and clone a class is a method to have another instance..
	
# QUESTION:

	How Annotations are working in Java?
	How you can implement a custom annotation?
	
ANSWER:
	
	Annotations is a way to put a metadata on some language construct e.g. class, variable, field, method. It means that 
	if you need to inform about some properties of the construct
	
	@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) //SOURCE,CLASS
	@Target(ElementType.METHOD) //can use in method only OR ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.PARAMETER, ElementType.CONSTRUCTOR,...
	public @interface Test {
 
		//should ignore this test?
		public boolean enabled() default true;
 
	}
